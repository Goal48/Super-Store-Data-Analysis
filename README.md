3. Data Exploration with SQL
Used SQL queries to answer business questions like:

How does West compare to East in terms of number of products sold?

What is the customer retention rate?

Who are the Top 10 customers by sales in each state?

How many customers haven't ordered in the last 2 months?

Which customers live in the same city?

4. Interactive Dashboards
Created dashboards using:

📊 Power BI

📈 Excel Slicers and Pivot Charts

Dashboards Include:
KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Order Value

Region-wise and Category-wise Sales Charts

Monthly Trend Line Charts

Top/Bottom Performing Products

Customer Segmentation
